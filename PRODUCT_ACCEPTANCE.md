# Product Acceptance Evidence

## Current checkpoint — 2026-11-14

Product acceptance remains **not granted**. PR #16 is the sole open PR. The
latest pushed `ac6e9fd` had Python jobs stop at Ruff format before test
execution. The test file is formatted locally and its 104 focused cases pass;
the fix push will rerun hosted checks. Preceding head `4738a01` passed Rust
workspace and Python/Rust compatibility on Linux, Windows, and macOS. The prior PR check remains
blocked by the unchanged context-band promotion gate at 0.6667 < 0.90.
TASK-130's full local regression passes 2,405 tests with 4 skips and its schema
suite passes 101 focused cases. TASK-131's 104 enum-focused cases and full
2,486/4 Python regression pass locally. Rust migration and product acceptance remain
incomplete; no production deployment or paid OpenAI request occurred.
The table below is historical.

## Historical assessment

_Current v0.5 release-candidate view, 2026-07-20. Historical per-task evidence is
retained under `loop/tasks/` and `loop/reports/`._

| Area | Implementation evidence | Verification state | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Routing, controls, taxonomy, offline mode | Core `agentrouter` modules and CLI | Existing unit/integration suites; final full rerun pending | Provisionally pass |
| Safety and execution policy | Safety gates, argv execution, URL protections | Existing safety/injection suites; final security rerun pending | Provisionally pass |
| API and SDKs | FastAPI service, Python SDK, TypeScript SDK | Python baseline plus TS typecheck and 8/8 tests | Provisionally pass |
| MCP | Read/route/explain surface; no execute tool | Existing MCP suite; clean-wheel baseline | Provisionally pass |
| Observability and service controls | Structured logs, optional OTel, limits, idempotency | Existing focused suites | Provisionally pass |
| Plugin lifecycle | Ownership state, exclusive backup, transaction recovery, link/reparse rejection, exact restore, safe empty-dir cleanup | 48 focused tests; independent final security re-audit pending | Pending |
| Evaluation | All 100 points measured; immutable context comparator; frozen dev/holdout split | 98.32/100 and six non-context gates pass | **Fail: held-out context gate 0.5778 < 0.90** |
| Mutation quality | Bounded mutmut 3.6.0 Linux runner, thresholds, survivor allowlist, artifact upload | Harness tests pass; first real Linux run pending | Pending |
| Packaging and supply chain | Wheel/sdist, SBOM, provenance, upgrade guide | Takeover baseline passed; final clean-environment rerun pending | Pending |
| Release CI | Strict evaluation and mutation workflows | Release branch not pushed yet | Pending |

## Release decision

Product acceptance is **not granted**. A high overall evaluation grade does not
override the failed frozen held-out context gate, and no mutation threshold is
accepted without a real Linux score. External production prerequisites—live
provider access, paid-model measurements, hosted operations, beta feedback, and
owner publication decisions—also remain outside this local release candidate.
