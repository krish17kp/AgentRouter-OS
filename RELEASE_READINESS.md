# Release Readiness

**Status: NOT release-ready.** Canonical v0.5 release-candidate assessment,
updated 2026-07-31 (iter21, after TASK-011 merged to `release/agentrouter-v0.5-rc1`).

The **only** remaining blocker is the frozen held-out context-band gate. It cannot
be closed by tuning — it needs the human-labelled dataset that TASK-011 tooling and
TASK-012 operations produce. The gate and its 0.90 threshold are unchanged.

## Current evidence

| Gate | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Offline routing and exact model/host output | Pass | Routing and CLI suites (RC) |
| High-risk execution and injection protections | Pass | Safety, execute, injection suites |
| Evaluation grade | Pass | ~98/100 canonical run; 6/7 gates pass |
| Six non-context evaluation gates | Pass | `artifacts/evaluation/result.json` |
| Frozen held-out context generalization | **Fail (by design)** | 0.6667 accuracy vs unchanged 0.90 threshold (shipped rules-active; TASK-009 proved the 24-case dev set is a ceiling) |
| Critical-module mutation thresholds | **Pass** | Linux mutmut 3.6.0, 923 mutants: overall 0.9837; safety_policy_execution 0.985 (>=0.95); routing_engine 0.9815 (>=0.85); no safety/policy/execution-bypass survivor |
| Safe reversible plugin lifecycle | Pass | Plugin suites green |
| Full local matrix | Pass | `pytest` 583+ passed, 1 env-skip (otel) |
| Linux/Windows GitHub checks | Pass except release-gate | CI matrix 3.10-3.13 + test-windows + build-smoke + Security + Critical Mutation Testing green on RC |
| Clean wheel install/lifecycle | Pass | Wheel builds; packaged data + `agentrouter dataset` CLI verified from a fresh venv |
| Context-band dataset program | Delivered (labels pending) | TASK-011 merged; final human labels are the external TASK-012 step |

The 0.945 value previously used for context readiness came from the 165-case
in-sample gold set. The canonical generalization gate now uses the frozen,
checksum-locked 45-case holdout and is deliberately not tuned after its final run.

## External production prerequisites

Live provider verification, paid-model benchmarking, hosted deployment,
marketplace publication, beta feedback, and operational sign-off still require
credentials, budget, infrastructure, or owner decisions. These do not excuse the
three local/CI blockers above.
